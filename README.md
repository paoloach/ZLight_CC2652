# Instruction

The power supply is 12 Volts. The maximum limits is set by the LM1117 chip that has a maximum input value of 15 Volts.
The consume is about 0.4 - 0.5 A, so the maximum  emitted light is about 5-6 Watt.
It implement a On/Off and Controll cluster, so you can reduce the luminosity.


The first time the ZLight start it search for a available network.
If you need to reset the network, press button 1 for more that 5 seconds.
